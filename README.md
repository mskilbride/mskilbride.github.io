This readme is still under construction.

This respository exists to serve as a play area for my experience with A-Frame and a resource to others. In this respository are a few files dedicated for beginners as they demonstrate the basic outline and functionality of A-Frame. There is a folder containing files dedicated towards testing add-in JavaScript components such as the physics system, images, grabbable objects, and creating new geometric entities. POC_Examples hosts proof of concept scenes that show more advanced A-Frame components including environments, physics, player-intitated interactions, scene manipulation, and JavaScript events.

This is all very much a beginners effort to learn and try to create something exciting. 

<ul>
  <li>
Assets -- This folder comprises of a few free or personally created textures for A-Frame materials. Some of the scenes in this repository links to them.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
featureTesting -- This folder comprises of a few scenes dedicated to testing some of the A-Frame community's JavaScript add-in packages. At the moment they include physics, superhands, and a minecraft-like block builder. It also includes a basic attempt to add an image into a scene. These are not necessarily paid attention to frequently and serve more as a place to keep files dedicated to testing components. 
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
HelloWorld -- This folder comprises of (currently) two very basic A-Frame scenes. The first, helloWorld.html, is a copy of the introduction scene from A-Frame's website. It serves as an extremely basic view into the framework. basic.html manipulates the scene to add some custom textures, animations, and lighting. More tutorial scenes will be added in the future. 
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
POC_Examples -- This folder comprises of 3 proof of concept scenes for A-Frame functionality. For me they serve as observable measurements for the possibility of the framework. They are basic but serve an important purpose towards my further progression into A-Frame. <strong> Right now they are only supported using full immersion headsets, like the HTC VIVE or Oculus Rift, support for keyboard and mouse will be coming in the future. </strong> There is a linking portal system where the player can move from scene to scene without removing the headset. It starts with index.html where the player can select their first experience. 
  </li>
        <ul> 
          <li> blockBuilder.html - A scene where a the player can create interconnecting boxes and teleport on top of them               </li>
          <li> handThrow.html - A scene where the player can spawn and throw spheres into distant targets. </li>
          <li> sceneChanger.html - A scene where the player can move between three different checkpoints and push buttons to      manipulate the scenery. </li>
        </ui>
  <br>
  <li>
  Scripts -- This folder consists of just main.js right now. It used to house physical copies of all the JavaScript Add-on packages but does no longer since they are all linked in the scenes. Main.js exists are the current moment because of it has some physical copies of a few custom-created a-frame components. None of the current scenes use this folder.
